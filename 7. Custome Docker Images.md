# Dockerfile
=============

A `Dockerfile` is a file that contains instructions to build the image.

We use it to specify application dependencies.

Naming convention: Dockerfile (if you use another name you need to use `-f /path/to/dockerfilename` in the build command)

![docker file to image to container](./resources/file-image-cont.jpg)

## Docker File Reference 

To see the docker file reference visit [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/).


## Instructions
-----------------------

- `FROM`: Base image.
- `MAINTAINER`: Person responsible for creating this image.
- `COPY/ADD`: Copy files from host to container.
-  `RUN`: Run commands during build process.
-  `CMD`: Run command when running the container (can be overridden by the user in the run command).
-  `EXPOSE`: Which ports the image uses.
-  `WORKDIR`: create/change the working directory inside the container.
-  `ENTRYPOINT`: Run command when running the container (can't be overridden by the user in the run command).



### FROM

`FROM` Create a new build stage from a base image.

we can select the base image we need from https://hub.docker.com

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.14.0a3-bookworm
```

After the file is saved let's build the image:
```bash
docker build -t python-server:1.0 .
```
This will create the image with the name python-server and a tag 1.0.

let's test the image by creating a container and attaching vs code to it.

```bash
docker run -d --name py-srvr python-server:1.0
```

notice that the container is not running. 

The reason is that there is no running process on the container so it exited.

to test it we can execute a command before it exits:

```bash
docker run python-server:1.0 cat /etc/os-release
```

### RUN

`RUN` Execute build commands.

suppose we need to add an app to the image:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.14.0a3-bookworm

RUN apt update && apt install curl

```

rebuild the image again.

### CMD/ENTRYPOINT

`CMD` Specify default commands.


to keep the container running edit the docker file:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.14.0a3-bookworm

RUN apt update && apt install curl

CMD ["sleep","infinity"]
```
The `CMD` instruction tells the container to run a command once it boots.

Now attach to the container, open a terminal, and execute the command `cat /etc/os-release`. also check to see that curl is present.

using `ENTRYPOINT`:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.14.0a3-bookworm

RUN apt update && apt install curl
ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
CMD ["infinity"]
```
**`NOTE: if you need to pass arguments in the docker run command DON'T use CMD use ENTRYPOINT`**

### WORKDIR

`WORKDIR` Change working directory.

suppose we need to execute instructions inside a certain directory inside the container like creating a file.

```Dockerfile

FROM python:3.14.0a3-bookworm

RUN apt update && apt install curl

WORKDIR /code
CMD ["touch","test.txt"]

CMD ["sleep","infinity"]

```

### COPY/ADD

`COPY` Copy files and directories.


`ADD` Add local or remote files (through URLs) and directories.


suppose you need to copy code into the container like if we want to create an image based on nginx that displays a custome static html instead of the default.
create a folder for this subproject and inside it create the static html file index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Unix Tools</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Welcome to the Unix Tools Course</h1>
    
</body>
</html>
```

now create a file called `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.27.0
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/ 
```

To build the image:

```bash
docker build -t mysite:latest .
```
- `-t`: tag the image with name mysite and tag latest.
- `.`: tells docker where the docker file is located.
now run the container mapping port 80.

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 mysite:latest
```

### EXPOSE

`EXPOSE` Describe which ports your application is listening on.
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.27.0
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
EXPOSE 80
```
