# Remote Repositories

## Main Features

1) Backup online.
2) 2-Way Sync.

Regular cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, ...) provide online backups and automatic 2-way sync.

`Code is never syncronized automatically because during development the code is practically broken.`

A git repo. is a folder that is being tracked by git.

**GitHub** is designed as an online storage for git repos.

Other examples include **Bitbucket** and **GitLab**.

using such services only need a few steps:

1) Create an online account.
2) Connect your local repo. to an online repo.
3) push and pull changes for 2-way sync.

## Create a github account

## Create a public repo

## Link and/or Unlink Local To Remote (HTTPS)
Now we have 2 repos. The **Local Repository** which is the project folder being tracked by git. and the **Remote Repository** which is the online repo we just created.

to link the repos just copy the code and use the follwoing command after navigating to the local repos' folder:

```bash
git remote add origin
 https://github.com/ibrahimamreya/git-tutorial.git
```
to get the info of the remote repo for the current local repo:

```bash
git remote
git remote -v
```

example output:

```bash
ibrahim@elastic:~/Desktop/git-tutorial$ git remote
origin
ibrahim@elastic:~/Desktop/git-tutorial$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/ibrahimamreya/git-tutorial.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/ibrahimamreya/git-tutorial.git (push)
```

to unlink your local repo from the remote repo:

```bash
git remote remove origin
```
## Sync Repos (push/pull)
**Upload = push**

**Download = pull**

In order to upload to the remote repo we need to provide our username on github to git:

```bash
git config --global credential.username "ibrahimamreya"
```

before trying to push our code we have to get an access tokent from gihub. [**Profile--> Settings--> Developer Settings--> Personal access tokens**] just check the Repo options when creating the token.

Now push your code and you will be prompted for a password just enter the token.

to push the code:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Enter the token when prompted.

**You will be asked to enter the token every time you push code**

to fix this we will remove the remote repo and re-add it using ssh.

```bash
git remote remove origin
```
## GitHub SSH Keys
In order to use ssh we need to generate a key and add it to our profile.

TO generate a private key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -C "ibrahimamreya@gtihub.com"
```

This key will be stored in `~/.ssh`.
copy the contents of the public key.

```bash
cat ~/ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
copy the entire output and got to your github icon then choose **settings**, **SSH and GPG** keys and create a **new key** with the value you copied.

to test if git is working from a terminal use the follwoing command:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
Now go to the repo online and copy the **ssh** link from the code button and inside your local repo in a terminal do:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:ibrahimamreya/git-tutorial.git
```

Now try to push and pull. it should work fine.

## Explore the GitHub Interface

## Shorthand Commands [set-upstream]

now sync the chnages: `git push origin main`.

To shorten the push and pull commands:

```bash
git pull origin main --set-upstream
```

```bash
git push origin main --set-upstream
```

now you can use the shorthand `git push` and `git pull`.
## Git only pushes commits not changes/files

**make a change then push without committing**

**Nothing happens**



## Branching Effect [amend]

if we amend a local commit a branch will be created.

make any change then:

```bash
git add .
git commit --amend -m "Version 12"
git log --all --graph
```

notice the branch created.

try to bush your changes to github.

An error will be generated.

To fix this we need to force the push using `-f` flag.

```bash
git push origin main -f
```

```bash
ibrahim@elastic:~/Desktop/git-tutorial$ git push -f

## Clone A Repository

to clone a repo use the command:

```bashAmend a local commit
git clone git@github.com:ibrahimamreya/git-tutorial.git
```

use the ssh link since we already have ssh keys working.

You can provide a name for the localfolder:


```bash
git clone git@github.com:ibrahimamreya/git-tutorial.git  my_project
```
## No Remote AutoSync [git fetch]
navigate to `my_project` create a file, add it to git, commit it and push to github.

**check the log on both local repos you will notice that the git-tutorial is out of sync even though it says it is**

**Remote do not get updated automatically**

to view the remote **origin/main** wihtout downloading use:

```bash
git fetch
```
now view the log again and notice that remote is a head of local.
```bash
ibrahim@elastic:~/Desktop/git-tutorial$ git fetch
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.

```

to fix this just pull the changes:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

then check the log.

## Practice

### case 1: Existing Project Folder

1) Run `git init`.
2) Create a commit.
3) Create a Repo on github.
4) add remote to local repo.
5) push to remote.

### Case 2: New Project

You can do as case 1 or:

1) Create an online repo.
2) clone the repo.
3) make changes, commit and push to github.
